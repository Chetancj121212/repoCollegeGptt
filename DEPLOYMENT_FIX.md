# Deployment Fix Guide

## Issue Summary

Your application was failing to deploy due to two main issues:

1. **Invalid Google API Key**: The Google AI API key was not valid or expired
2. **Chain Initialization Error**: The RAG chain was failing to initialize when the retriever was `None`

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Code Fixes

- Updated `backend/main.py` to handle cases where the retriever fails to initialize
- Added proper error checking before creating the RAG chain
- Modified the chat endpoint to check both retriever and chain availability
- Updated the refresh data endpoint to properly recreate the chain

### 2. Environment Variable Updates

- Updated `.env` file with placeholder for valid Google API key
- Updated `.env.example` file to remove hardcoded sensitive values

## Steps to Complete the Fix

### 1. Get a New Google API Key

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Create a new API key
4. Copy the API key

### 2. Update Your Environment Variables

1. Open `backend/.env`
2. Replace `your_valid_google_api_key_here` with your actual Google API key:
   ```
   GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_actual_api_key_here"
   ```

### 3. Update Render Environment Variables

Since you're deploying on Render, you need to update the environment variables in your Render dashboard:

1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Select your service
3. Go to "Environment" tab
4. Update `GOOGLE_API_KEY` with your new API key
5. Save and redeploy

### 4. Verify Other API Keys

Make sure these are also valid:

- `ASTRA_DB_API_ENDPOINT`
- `ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN`
- `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING`
- `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`

## Testing the Fix

After updating the environment variables and redeploying:

1. Check the deployment logs for any errors
2. Test the API endpoints:
   - `GET /` - Should return status message
   - `POST /api/chat` - Should handle chat requests (may return error message if vector store isn't initialized, but shouldn't crash)

## Prevention

To prevent this issue in the future:

1. Never commit real API keys to version control
2. Always use environment variables for sensitive data
3. Regularly rotate API keys
4. Test with valid credentials before deploying

## Error Handling

The application now gracefully handles:

- Invalid API keys (returns error message instead of crashing)
- Failed vector store initialization
- Missing retriever or chain objects

This ensures the application starts successfully even if some services are unavailable.
